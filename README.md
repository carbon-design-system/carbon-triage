## Usage

You can run the triage utility with the `npx` tool by running:

npx @carbon/triage
```

You will need access to a [GitHub access token](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line)
in order to use this tool. In addition to running it using `npx` above, you can
also set the GitHub token as an environment variable to skip the GitHub prompt:
